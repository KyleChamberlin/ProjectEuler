ProjectEuler
============

Attempts at solving various Project Euler problems, original problems can be found at http://projecteuler.net

Several solutions were coded some years ago, and I am in the process of updating and refactoring them. after reading "Clean Code" by Uncle Bob, I nearly want to through the code away, but instead I have chosen to write tests and refactor these, as a lesson in maintaning old code.
